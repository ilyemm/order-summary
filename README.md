## My process

This was just another practice with SCSS! I focused on making sure I was making effective use of the hierarchical part of what makes SCSS so helpful to use. I'm going to focus on learning the other syntax around it moving forward. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS/SASS

### What I learned

My main focus was just practicing SCSS/SASS. I didn't do anything too advanced since I'm just trying to familiarize myself with the syntax. 

### Continued development

I don't see anything specific I need to fix. I'll come back to this when I get more practice with animations since that's something I need to learn.
